With our detailed consultation process, our team aims to create a healthy state that will lead to a culture of multiplying disciples for God's Kingdom to advance. I love God's Church, and we desire to see disciples created for His glory. There is no secret to growth. However, we do know God will do his part. The question remains, 'Will you do yours?'</p>
